# Lambda Script
Lambda Script is a joke "programming" language I made in like 15 minutes.

## Installation

- Clone the repo
- Compile the interpreter `gcc lambda.c -o lambda`
- Run the interpreter `./lambda <filename.lambda>`

## How it works:
It's basically a simple binary-to-text converter but the 1's and 0's are swapped out with Λ and λ
So the input:
```
λΛΛλλλλΛ λΛΛΛΛλΛλ λΛΛλλΛλΛ
```
Would give the output:
```
aze
```
